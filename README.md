What I've refactored & why:

1)	Refactor the PaymentService to comply with the Single Responsibility Principle by separating concerns such as configuration access, data store selection, payment validation, and balance updates into distinct components.

2)	Implement a Controller → Service architecture:
•	The Controller (API layer) handles HTTP concerns, input validation via data annotations, and model binding.
•	The Service encapsulates business rule validation and core payment logic.

3)	Replace the switch statement used for payment scheme selection with a generic validator:
•	Created a single service that consolidates validation logic for all payment schemes.
•	The original code had different checks for different payment schemes; refactored so that common checks (account is live, balance >= amount, account not null) apply universally.
•	Injected the validator into the PaymentService to support extensibility and maintainability.
•	Updated the success logic to default to false unless explicitly set to true (guard clause pattern).

5)	Apply the Dependency Inversion Principle by introducing an IAccountDataStore interface:
•	Created new interface with ‘GetAccount’ and ‘UpdateAccount’ methods.
•	Both ‘AccountDataStore’ and ‘BackupAccountDataStore’ now implement new interface to enables mocking for unit testing and removes repetitive if/else logic based on dataStoreType.

6)	Refactor the logic for retrieving dataStoreType:
•	Used Factory pattern by moving this responsibility to ‘ConfigAccountDataStoreFactory’ which reads from ‘IConfiguration’.

7)	Add null checks, structured logging, and exception handling throughout the service and handler classes to improve robustness and observability.

8)	Implement Unit tests for ‘PaymentService’ and new ‘PaymentValidatorService’.

If I had more time, I would implement the following:
•	Add Asynchronous operations as all methods are currently synchronous, this would prevent blocking threads during operations.
•	If this was code for a PROD system, I would have checked that the business logic applied in the original version of the code was correct (i.e. checking if the account balance is less than the request amount for FasterPayments only, I have assumed that this logic should apply to all payment schemes). If different validation logic did apply to specific payment schemes, I would have implemented a validation handler for each using the Strategy pattern.
•	Integration tests.
